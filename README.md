  * Open a second terminal tab *(Mac: cmd + T)*
  * Navigate back to the root the repo
  * `npm run dev-server`

>This will run the api server with nodemon on port 1337 (Allowing the server to auto refresh on save).

## Production Process
* **Building**
 * `npm run build`
 
>This will place the bundle.js file into the public folder.
>*Note: public/bundle.js is git ignored.*

* **Serving**
